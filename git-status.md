# Definition: git status

The command 'git status' is a Git command to show various status of the directory. It is a very safe command to use as it does not make any changes to the directory.  

This command returns useful information such as: 

-  identifying the repository branch you are on
- whether there branch is up to date, ahead, or behind in commits (as compared to the upstream repository)
- list of files that are have been changed and staged
- list of files that have been changed, but remain unstaged
- list of untracked files 
- includes suggested commands


To access the same information using JupyterLab IDE, navigate to Git sidebar menu, under the 'Changes' tab, there are sections for 'Staged', 'Changed', and 'Untracked'.  

Note the JupyterLab IDE does not provide suggested commands, which is one advantage of using the 'git status' command via the Terminal.
